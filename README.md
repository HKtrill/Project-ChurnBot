# 🤖 Project ChurnBot: Turning Churn Into Intelligence

**Tech Stack:** 🗄️ SQLite, 📊 Jupyter, 🐍 Python, 🔥 PyTorch, 🔧 MLOps, 💻 TypeScript, 🐳 Docker, ⚛️ React, 🌐 Node.js

**Author:** 👤 Phillip Harris

## 📖 Synopsis

ChurnBot transforms telecommunications customer retention from guesswork into precision science. It is an intelligent AI assistant built specifically for telecom churn patterns. Unlike general-purpose models, ChurnBot focuses on telecom-specific behaviors to provide accurate, actionable insights where it matters most.

## 🚨 Problem Statement: Traditional AI Approaches Miss Telecom-Specific Signals

General-purpose models often treat telecom churn like a standard classification task, potentially missing critical domain-specific signals:
- **Call patterns** and usage anomalies
- **Billing disputes** and payment behaviors  
- **Service degradation** indicators
- **Subscription anomalies** and plan changes

**Result:** High false positives/negatives → wasted marketing spend & preventable customer churn.

ChurnBot addresses these gaps with specialized telecom intelligence that general-purpose models may not fully capture.

## 🧠 Core Thesis: Specialized Smaller Models > Generic Larger Models

**Research Hypothesis:** Domain-specific smaller models consistently outperform massive general-purpose LLMs on specialized tasks like telecom churn prediction.

**Key Arguments:**
- 🎯 **Focused Architecture:** Smaller models trained on domain-specific data capture nuanced patterns that large models miss
- ⚡ **Computational Efficiency:** Specialized models achieve superior performance with dramatically lower computational overhead
- 🔍 **Signal vs. Noise:** Smaller models avoid the "curse of generalization" that causes larger models to dilute domain-specific signals
- 💡 **Feature Engineering Advantage:** Traditional ML techniques (feature engineering, ensemble methods) outperform brute-force parameter scaling

This thesis challenges the current industry assumption that "bigger is always better" by demonstrating measurable superiority in precision, recall, and resource efficiency for domain-specific applications.

## 🎯 Domain-Specific Intelligence
### Three-Stage Cascade Model
- **🧠 Artificial Neural Network** → Complex relationship modeling  
- **🚀 Gradient Boosting** → Final prediction refinement

This specialized pipeline is optimized for precision + recall in telecom churn, detecting patterns that general-purpose models may not generalize effectively.

### Pipeline Architecture
```
data_loader → preprocessor → feature_engineer → leakage_monitor → cascade_model → experiment_runner
```

## 🎯 Choose Your Experience

**⚡ Terminal Version (Light):** For telecom analysts and technical teams — fast, efficient insights through command-line interaction.

**📈 Dashboard Version (Heavy):** For telecom executives — rich visualizations and executive-ready presentations.

Both versions are specialized for telecom churn, analyzing call patterns, data usage shifts, billing disputes, and service degradation that general-purpose models may not capture. All computations run locally, keeping sensitive subscriber data on your network.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security: Local-First Philosophy

ChurnBot runs entirely on your machine with **zero cloud dependencies**:
- ✅ **No external data transfers** — sensitive subscriber data never leaves your network
- ✅ **No monthly fees** or API costs
- ✅ **Full data sovereignty** — maintain compliance and avoid regulatory penalties
- ✅ **Immediate analysis** — no network latency or downtime

Compare this to general-purpose models that may rely on cloud APIs with inherent data exposure risks.
